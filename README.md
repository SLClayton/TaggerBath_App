# Tagger Bath - Android App

This repo is home to the front end Java Android Application.

The repo for the [backend Python code that runs on Google Cloud can be found here](https://github.com/SLClayton/TaggerBath_Backend).

Tagger Bath is a location based, team oriented, 'land grab' game where you are assigned a team and must capture real world locations by walking towards them. This game was designed to encourage physical activity through competition.

User's login via a Facebook account and are immediatley assigned a team of either Red, Green or Blue. Once assigned, users can watch themselves walk around a map on screen capturing grid squares for their team as they walk around the real world. An empty grid square is grey, once it is captured it will change to your teams colour. For every minute your team holds each grid square, you and your team will earn 1 point. Steal enemy squares to stop them gaining points and capture squares a teammate has already captured to multiply the points earned per minute.
